Enhanced Malware Detection Using Forward Feature Selection and Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced malware detection system utilizing forward feature selection and machine learning techniques. By systematically selecting the most relevant features and training robust classification models, the goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of malware detection processes.

Features
Forward Feature Selection: Iteratively select the most discriminative features to reduce dimensionality and enhance model performance.
Wrapper Methods: Evaluate feature subsets within the context of specific classification algorithms to optimize feature selection.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilize Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification tasks.
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Assess feature relationships and identify informative attributes for model training.
