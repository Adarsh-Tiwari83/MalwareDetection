# Enhanced Malware Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model for malware detection using Python. The model utilizes three different classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. It also incorporates feature selection techniques including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Pearson Correlation, and Forward Feature Selection.
